# iLambda/PBCharacterMovement

This is a fork of [ProjectBorealis/PBCharacterMovement](https://github.com/ProjectBorealis/PBCharacterMovement), which aims to add features that were left out and/or not implemented at all in the original repo.
All of the added mechanics are similar to some of other Source Engine based games, like TF|2 and Apex Legends.

A non-exhaustive list of such improvements:
* Swimming
* Powersliding (based on Apex Legends sliding mechanics)
* **[To be implemented]** Ladder climbing (based on Half Life 1 ladder physics)
* **[To be implemented]** Wallrunning (based on [Titanfall 2 wallrunning mechanics](https://youtu.be/n1mbGmOZWcU))
* **[To be implemented]** Mantling (idem)

The aforementioned mechanics are not supposed to be a 1:1 replica of the Source games they come from, but instead a good approximation of these movement mechanics, with basic movement tech being able to be replicated, such as:
* Lurching
* Slide jumping
* ... and others

## Original repository
 
All basic information pertaining to walking, running, jumping, and crouching can be found on the [original repo](https://github.com/ProjectBorealis/PBCharacterMovement).
[Their blog](https://www.projectborealis.com/movement) also details some of the specifics of how the mechanics are implemented.
